/**
 * COP 2551: Project 5 â€“ Tic-Tac-Toe
 * <p>
 * The TicTacToeGame class represents a one player vs the computer game of 
 * Tic-Tac-Toe.  The human player gets to pick whether they want to be X or O
 * and then the first person to move is chosen at random.  The game uses 
 * JOptionPane's to interact with the user both to display data and to accept
 * input.  There is also some input validation with error reporting.
 * <p>
 * The computer's algorithm makes it intelligent enough to see immediate
 * moves, where the user could move next to win, or where it could move next in  
 * order to win but is totally random in its selections beyond that.
 * <p>
 * The following is a set of examples of the output that could result from a 
 * game of Tic-Tac-Toe, depicting a game where the computer wins, an example of
 * an error in input from the user and the response, and each of three possible 
 * ending frames: the computer winning, the user winning, or a tie.  These are 
 * represented in text format, but in actual play the messages would appear 
 * in JOptionPane windows.
 * <p>
 * COP 2551 Project 5 - Brad Walsh

     * Algorithm:
     *
     * 1. The board is initialized with the values 1 to 9, from left to right 
     * and then top down
     * 
     * 2. A window is displayed with intro information which asks whether the 
     * user wants to be X or O
     * 
     * 3. Formatting for JOptionPane windows is set for font and color
     * 
     * 4. Which player is to go first is established by random number generator
     * 
     * 5. Players take turns picking spots to move into until one wins or all 
     * the spots are filled in resulting in a tie (assuming no one won)
     * 
     *     C1. Computer checks to see if there is a space it can move into and 
     *     win, if so it does
     * 
     *     C2. Computer checks to see if there is a spot the user can move into
     *     which would result in a win.  If so, it moves there
     * 
     *     C3. Otherwise the computer moves to a random spot
     * 
     *     U1. The user is presented with the current board and asked to select
     *     a spot.  
     * 
     *     U2. If the user selects CANCEL here, the game exits
     * 
     *     U3. Error checking is conducted on the user's input, if it passes,
     *     the spot is recorded for the user, otherwise an error message is 
     *     displayed and the user is asked to try again.
     * 
     * 6. A final results window is displayed showing the board and winner/tie
